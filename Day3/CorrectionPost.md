# Mistake in initial Java 7 and Java 8 code causing Runtime error:
The main function provided is not reading the chess board properly and hence, is causing a runtime error. Currently, the main function is:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int t = in.nextInt();
for(int a0 = 0; a0 < t; a0++){
    char[][] board = new char[8][8];
    for(int board_i = 0; board_i < 8; board_i++){
        for(int board_j = 0; board_j < 8; board_j++){
	        board[board_i][board_j] = in.next().charAt(0);
        }
    }
    int result = waysToGiveACheck(board);
    System.out.println(result);
}
in.close();
}
```

But this only takes each line, reads the first character and ditches the rest upon the next iteration - Specifically the part
```java
board[board_i][board_j] = in.next().charAt(0);
```

The in.next() method reads in a line but calling it again in the next loop causes the Scanner to ditch the previously read line. However, not all the characters have been collected from the line because the above line of code only reads the first character in the line (Or the character at index 0). At a certain point, all the lines are read (With only the first characters of each line collected) but the double loop will continue to read lines as if there are more characters to collect (But there aren't, which is why this gives a java.util.NoSuchElementException runtime error)

A functional implementation would be:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int t = in.nextInt();
for(int a0 = 0; a0 < t; a0++){
    char[][] board = new char[8][8];
    for(int board_i = 0; board_i < 8; board_i++){
        String line = in.next();
        for(int board_j = 0; board_j < 8; board_j++){
            board[board_i][board_j] = line.charAt(board_j);
        }
    }
    int result = waysToGiveACheck(board);
    System.out.println(result);
}
in.close();
}
```

So, if you are using Java and are running into runtime errors, try replacing the main function you have with the main function above to see if that fixes the problem.
